# INFERNO – THE PLATFORM OF DOOM

## Origin
Planet Antares (inspired by Earth)

## Buff granted
Increased fire damage + magic penetration for 5 minutes.

## Appearance
A living oil platform, with crane-like arms, column legs, cannons, and flaming eyes.

## Lore
Born from the hatred and ambition of greedy businessmen who monopolized fuel and manipulated the masses. Possessed by Stanás, Inferno became a living entity and devoured its creators. Frey and Freya asked the Angel Gabriel to remove it from Antares.

He was brought to Valhalla Rising — not for redemption, but for punishment. After his cycle, he will be destroyed forever.
