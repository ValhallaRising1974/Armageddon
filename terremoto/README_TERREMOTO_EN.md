# TERREMOTO – THE SCREAMING MOUNTAIN

## Origin
Planet Sirius

## Buff granted
+15% Total Health and +25% Armor for 6 minutes

## Appearance
A colossal creature of stone and moss, with flaming eyes, craters on its back, and fists that shake the ground.

## Lore
Once a peaceful mountain, it became a monster after the soul of a righteous man — a Salvation Army leader — was fused into its rock by a betrayal ritual. Good had won the war… but lost its hero. Driven mad by the pain of seeing his family slaughtered by those he trusted, Terremoto now roars with hate and despair.

Balder pleaded for his soul. Frey and Freya, with the Angel Gabriel, sealed him in Valhalla Rising.

When the cycle ends, the man shall be restored… and reunited with his family in the light.
