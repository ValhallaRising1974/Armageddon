# Primaveril – The Corrupted Goddess

**Created by Marcelo on July 7, 2017. Added to the repository on April 6, 2025.**

Primaveril is the goddess of the Floral Planet, the source of all life and natural energy. Created by the supreme beings to sustain life, she provided clean air, pure water, natural food, and distributed stellar energy.

Lucifer arrived on the Floral Planet disguised as a kind and noble man. He claimed he wanted to marry the goddess and have children. Innocent and unaware of malice, Primaveril fell in love. She bore him two children, both of whom died shortly after birth. In despair, she accepted an elixir he offered — made from the dissolved bodies of their children. Her pain turned into madness and hatred, and she became a monstrous, devouring being.

Lucifer laughed at the destruction until the Angel Mehiel imprisoned him. Frey and Freya intervened and brought Primaveril to the Valhalla Rising – The Parchment tournament. There, she would grant buffs to champions as a path to purification, hoping to return one day to her world, redeemed.
