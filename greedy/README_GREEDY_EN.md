# GREEDY – THE EMBODIMENT OF GREED

## Origin
Planet Capitallis

## Buff granted
A large amount of gold for all players who defeat her.

## Appearance
A colossal "$" symbol, covered in moss and gemstones, with smoke tentacles and hollow eyes glowing in venomous green.

## Attacks
- **Golden Coins** – magical impact projectiles.
- **Gemstones** – massive physical damage.
- **Shadow Tentacles** – if they grab a player, the gold buff is lost!

## Lore
An ancient demoness from the planet of corruption. She tried to deceive Cognatos, a hellish lord, but her own greed was turned against her. She went mad. The angel Malaquias, representative of prosperity and health, intervened, and Frey and Freya brought her to Valhalla Rising to offer a chance for balance through collective giving.

Today, she offers gold... but only to those who turn away from greed.
